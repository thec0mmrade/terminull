# Welcome to terminull

The screen flickers to life. Another terminal, another connection. But this one is different.

**terminull** is not just another security publication. It's a return to roots. A callback to the days when knowledge was shared freely, when the underground was a community, and when a well-crafted ASCII banner was a mark of pride.

## Why Another Zine?

The infosec landscape has changed. Corporate blogs optimize for SEO. Conference talks are marketing vehicles. Bug bounty platforms have gamified what used to be an art form.

We're not here to play that game.

> [!HACK] terminull is a space for technical depth, creative expression, and the hacker ethos that built the internet.

## What You'll Find Here

Each volume of terminull contains:

* **Editorials** -- Thoughts on the state of security and hacker culture
* **Guides** -- Deep technical dives into exploitation, reverse engineering, and defense
* **Writeups** -- CTF solutions, vulnerability research, and war stories
* **Art** -- ASCII and ANSI art from the community
* **Fiction** -- Because hackers have always been storytellers
* **News** -- A curated roundup of what matters in security

## How to Navigate

If you're reading this in a terminal (as intended), you can use the command prompt at the bottom:

```
guest@terminull:~$ help        # show available commands
guest@terminull:~$ read 01     # read article #01
guest@terminull:~$ ls           # list articles in current volume
guest@terminull:~$ crt          # toggle CRT scanline effect
```

Or use keyboard shortcuts: `j`/`k` to navigate, `Enter` to select, `?` for help.

## A Note on Ethics

Everything published in terminull is for **educational purposes**. We believe in responsible disclosure, ethical research, and the principle that understanding systems deeply -- including their flaws -- makes everyone safer.

> [!WARN] Never use techniques described here against systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.

## Get Involved

terminull is community-driven. We welcome contributions from researchers, artists, writers, and anyone who believes knowledge should be free.
