# About terminull

**terminull** is an independent hacker e-zine published in the spirit of the classic underground publications that shaped internet culture.

## Philosophy

We believe in:

* **Free knowledge** -- Information wants to be free. Technical knowledge should be accessible to all.
* **Technical depth** -- Surface-level content is everywhere. We go deep.
* **Hacker culture** -- The original meaning: curiosity, creativity, and the drive to understand how things work.
* **Art and aesthetics** -- The terminal is beautiful. ASCII art is legitimate art.
* **Community** -- We're stronger when we share and teach.

## Format

terminull is published as a static website designed to look and feel like a 1990s BBS. Articles are written in markdown and rendered with a custom terminal aesthetic. The entire site is navigable via keyboard commands, just like the real thing.

## Contributing

We welcome submissions in any of our categories:

* Editorials and opinion pieces
* Technical guides and tutorials
* CTF writeups and vulnerability research
* ASCII and ANSI art
* Fiction and creative writing
* Tool reviews and announcements

## Technical Details

This site is built with Astro, renders to static HTML, and requires zero JavaScript for core functionality. Keyboard navigation and the command prompt are progressive enhancements.

The source code is available on GitHub.
