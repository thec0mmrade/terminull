# The terminull Manifesto

We are hackers, researchers, artists, and builders.

We believe that the most interesting things happen at the intersection of curiosity and constraint. That understanding a system deeply -- including its flaws -- is a form of respect. That sharing knowledge is not just generous, but necessary.

## We Reject

* Security through obscurity as a primary defense
* Gatekeeping of technical knowledge
* The commodification of vulnerability research
* Surveillance capitalism
* The death of the weird internet

## We Embrace

* Responsible disclosure and ethical research
* Creative expression in digital mediums
* Open source and open knowledge
* Privacy as a fundamental right
* The beauty of the command line

## Our Promise

Every article in terminull will be:

1. **Technically accurate** -- We verify our claims
2. **Educational** -- Understanding is the goal
3. **Ethical** -- We promote responsible security research
4. **Free** -- No paywalls, no tracking, no ads
5. **Permanent** -- Published content stays published

## The Old Ways

The hacker zine is one of the oldest forms of internet publishing. From Phrack to 2600, from HITB to Uninformed, these publications shaped the culture we inhabit.

terminull is not a revival. It's a continuation.

The terminal never died. It was just waiting for you to connect.
